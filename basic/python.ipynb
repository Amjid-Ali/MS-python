    "# Introduction to Python\n",
    "- Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a high-level, general-purpose, interpreted programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) High-level\n",
    "Python is a high-level programming language that makes it easy to learn. Python doesn‚Äôt require you to understand the details of the computer in order to develop programs efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) General-purpose\n",
    "Python is a general-purpose language. It means that you can use Python in various domains including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Web applications\n",
    "Big data applications\n",
    "Testing\n",
    "Automation\n",
    "Data science, machine learning, and AI\n",
    "Desktop software\n",
    "Mobile apps\n",
    "The targeted language like SQL which can be used for querying data from relational databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Interpreted\n",
    "Python is an interpreted language. To develop a Python program, you write Python code into a file called source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "To execute the source code, you need to convert it to the machine language that the computer can understand. And the Python interpreter turns the source code, line by line, once at a time, into the machine code when the Python program executes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compiled languages like Java and C# use a compiler that compiles the whole source code before the program executes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Python versions\n",
    "Python has two major versions: 2x and 3x.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 2.x was released in 2000. The latest version is 2.7 released in 2010. It isn‚Äôt recommended for use in new projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 3.x was released in 2008. Basically, Python 3 isn‚Äôt compatible with Python 2. And you should use the latest versions of Python 3 for your new projects. Python 3 is most stable version upto now. \n",

    "## The Reasons\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python increases your productivity. Python allows you to solve complex problems in less time and fewer lines of code. It‚Äôs quick to make a prototype in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python becomes a solution in many areas across industries, from web applications to data science and machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python is quite easy to learn in comparison with other programming languages. Python syntax is clear and beautiful.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python has a large ecosystem that includes lots of libraries and frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python is cross-platform. Python programs can run on Windows, Linux, and macOS.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python has a huge community. Whenever you get stuck, you can get help from an active community.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python developers are in high demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Python Syntax compared to other programming languages\n",
    " \n",
    "- Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.\n",
    "- Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.\n",
    "- Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose"
